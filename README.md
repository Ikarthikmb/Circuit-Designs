## [1-Breadboard Power Supply](#contents)

- Converts the input ac/dc voltage(which does not exceed 35V) to output of 5 volts. This can be used to power circuits that require 5V as input supply for example Arduino(Requires 5V input power supply).
- **Connections:** Connect a input power supply to the jack and the output is obtained fron pin heads.
- To view/modify the source file, download the repository and navigate to `1-Breadboard Power Supply` folder and open the `bread power supply schematic.pro` project file in KiCAD.
