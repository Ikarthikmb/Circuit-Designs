## Counter:

- A counter is a device which stores (and sometimes displays) the number of times a particular event or process has occurred, often in relationship to a clock. 

##  Asynchronous (ripple) counter

- An asynchronous (ripple) counter is a "chain" of toggle (T) flip-flops wherein the least-significant flip-flop (bit 0) is clocked by an external signal (the counter input clock) and all other flip-flops are clocked by the output of the nearest, less significant flip-flop (e.g., bit 0 clocks the bit 1 flip-flop, bit 1 clocks the bit 2 flip-flop, etc.).

##  Synchronous counter

- In a synchronous counter, the clock inputs of the flip-flops are connected together and all flip-flops are simultaneously triggered by the common clock. Consequently, all of the flip-flops change state at the same time (in parallel). 

##  Decade counter

A decade counter is one that counts in decimal digits, rather than binary. A decade counter may have each (that is, it may count in binary-coded decimal, as the 7490 integrated circuit did) or other binary encodings. A decade counter is a binary counter that is designed to count to 1010 (decimal 10).
